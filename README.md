# Template-AppIcons-iOS-P3
Corrected version of Apple's iOS 11 Template for AppIcons.

## Problem
Apple's Sketch template involves resizing the Symbol layer which causes unwanted artefacts and rendering issues espeically when you have rounded rectangles in your design. 

## Solution
The correction for this is simply to use the Symbol layer at it's full size and apply scaling on it instead. This preserves all intended details. However, for optimum detail preservation, you are always recommended to work on each size individually than using a template.
